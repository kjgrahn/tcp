.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B tcp
(I couldn't come up with a better name)
is a tool for watching mostly binary protocols over TCP,
in situations where TCP itself is trouble-free.
.
.PP
.BR tcpdump (1)
gives you, for this purpose, too many details and
makes it hard to focus on just the payload.
.BR tcpflow (1)
is mostly intended to save different flows to files (and, it seems, focuses
on application-level protocols like HTTP).
With the
.B \-CD
options to print to stdout it is underdeveloped: the output
lacks timestamps and SYN/FIN/RST information.
.
.PP
.B tcp
simply prints the contents of each TCP segment, and the
.BR SYN / FIN / RST
flags.  It prints the timestamp with millisecond precision,
prints the source and destination ports,
and optionally colorizes the output.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.BP \-w,\ --width\ \fIn
Output width; default 80 characters.
.
.BP \-c,\ --color
Colorize the output.
Data to low ports (presumably client-to-server)
is yellow and other data (server-to-client) is green.
.
.BP \-a,\ --ascii
Print as ASCII instead of hexdumped octets. Anything nonprintable
is replaced by dots (so you lose information this way).
.
.BP \-i\ \fIiface
Listen on
.IR iface ,
e.g.
.BR eth0 ,
.B lo
or
.BR any .
.
.BP \-r\ \fIfile
Read packets from
.IR file .
.B -
means standard input.
.
.IP \fIexpression
BPF filter to apply to the interface or file; see
.BR pcap-filter (7)
for syntax.
.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.IP \- 3x
IP fragments are ignored.
.IP \-
Packets with IPv6 extension headers aren't handled well.
.IP \-
Odd capture formats aren't handled well.
I've only added support for Ethernet captures, VLAN, and raw IP captures.
.IP \-
There's no handling of TCP state.  Segments are printed as-is;
if data is retransmitted you'll see it twice
(this can be confusing).
ACKs and sequence numbers in general aren't handled at all.
(Thus the \[lq]when TCP itself is trouble-free\[rq] above).
.IP \-
TCP sessions are identified only by the port numbers involved.
This is for readability purposes, but also makes it hard to watch
many sessions between many hosts.
.IP \-
It's all a quick hack.
You probably shouldn't feed
.B tcp
untrusted data; there are ample opportunities for someone to
feed it crafted packets which makes it crash or worse.
.
.PP
If you need more, you should consider using
.BR tcpdump (1),
.BR tcpflow (1)
or
.BR tcptrace (1),
or a combination.
